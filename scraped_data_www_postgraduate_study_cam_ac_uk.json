      "If you wish to undertake a research degree you should first make sure that the appropriate faculty or department has the necessary expertise and resources. Some faculties ask that you identify a suitable supervisor before you submit your application. The course information available in the Course Directory should have information about if, when, and how you should identify a suitable supervisor. Please consult the faculty or department website if you need more guidance, and if you are still unsure contact the faculty directly for advice.",
      "If you choose a dissertation topic outside the immediate area of the supervisors available, or which is not considered feasible given the time allowed for the degree and resources available in the University or by arrangement elsewhere, it will not be possible to admit you to a research degree.",
      "If you wish to change your research topic once admitted, or at the point of continuing from a master's degree to the PhD, so that it falls outside the limits of what the Degree Committee judges can reasonably be provided, you may not be allowed to continue.",
      "If your funding is tied to a particular research topic (for example, by the terms of a sponsorship agreement) you will have little scope to change it later.",
      "If you are admitted after having carried out research towards a doctorate at another University and you wish to pursue the same topic at Cambridge, you must declare that the work has not and will not be submitted at the other university for any qualification; we may seek verification from the other institution. Although you will have been accepted on the basis that the topic of work can be supported by the department or faculty, you must be prepared to allow the research to be guided by the Cambridge supervisor and to observe the academic conventions pertaining to the new department or faculty.",
      "Equally, you should bear in mind that you cannot expect to receive resources to follow any particular line of study that you wish, unless a specific technique or requirement has been specifically agreed with the institution at the outset.",
      "The requirements for space and general research resources will be specific to the subject of research. Your faculty, department or institution is responsible for providing the basic requirements appropriate to your subject area and agreed research topic. This includes the provision of basic accommodation (such as, for scientists, bench space) according to the needs of the subject; this is likely to be in a mixture of private and shared study and recreational space.",
      "At a very early stage you and your supervisor should agree on a short written proposal, which indicates the aims and justification of the dissertation, the main research questions, literature and investigative work to be covered, and a very provisional outline of chapter titles and sub-headings. There should also be a written plan or timetable indicating how the work is going to be undertaken and identifying critical points when you will meet with your supervisor or otherwise be in contact with each other.",

If you are made a conditional offer, you will be asked to do this by completing a  Financial Undertaking Form",
      "We have estimated average basic living costs for a full-time student without dependants for 2025/26 to be £19,020.",

We will do a further check in November, but applicants should be aware that because the estimate relies on forecasts calculated in advance, living costs may rise above the suggested figure before they arrive in Cambridge.",
      "The annual estimate above is included in the ‘minimum financial undertaking’ that you commit to via the  Financial Undertaking Form.",
      "The estimates in the table are based on an average (median) student. In reality, total expenditure and expenditure by category will vary significantly from student to student and you should plan for any additional costs from your lifestyle and preferences.",
      "Research students should ensure they have sufficient funds to support themselves for the full duration of their course, which will be a minimum of 3 years and can extend up to 4 years.",
      "The maintenance sum required in your offer does not include travel to and from Cambridge.",
      "We do not provide an estimate of maintenance costs for part-time students, as these vary widely between different home locations and circumstances. If you are offered a place for part-time study, you will need to make your own estimate when completing the Financial Undertaking Form. Further guidance can be found at Maintenance costs for part-time students.",
      "Arriving in Cambridge from overseas and starting here as a student will have some costs. For example, travel costs and potentially Visa and Health Surcharge costs, which are not included in the figures above. You should budget for these costs separately. It’s worthwhile planning for these in advance, so they don’t come as a surprise or cause financial problems. Further guidance on costs of arrival can be found on the International Students website.",
      "Additional provision for accompanying dependants should be made. You should allow approximately 50% of the above estimate for an accompanying adult and 30% for each accompanying child. The financial condition specified in your offer letter takes account of your statement about accompanying dependants in your application form. Scholarships do not usually provide maintenance for dependants. You may not bring additional dependants to Cambridge before evidence of the extra financial support required has been supplied and the consent of your College obtained.",
      "The cost of childcare in Cambridge is extremely high. Full-time nursery care for pre-school children is very expensive for students ineligible for UK Government support. These costs are in addition to the figures requested for your financial guarantee.",
      "You can find out more about childcare in Cambridge on the University's Childcare Office website. This also gives potential costs for University-run day nurseries, but note that many private nurseries in Cambridge will have higher fees.",
      "If you undertake a course involving expensive laboratory materials, you may be expected to contribute towards the cost of your research (in addition to the University Composition Fee). You can find information about this by visiting the finance tab on your course page in the Course Directory. Some courses may involve extra costs for special elements such as conference visits or field trips. Please check the course application information to find out if you will need to make additional provision for this. Please note: the payment for these course costs is arranged through your department, not the Student Registry or the College.",

Faculties or Departments may agree to provide feedback (though they are not obliged to do so) and should be contacted directly.",

      "If your admissions appeal does relate to your exam performance it will, in general, only be considered once all relevant exam appeal and mitigation processes have been completed. For students taking a degree at Cambridge this will be the exam allowance or examination review process, as appropriate. In such cases, the 28-day deadline for making an admission appeal will start from the completion of the exam appeal.

      "This page describes how to appeal a postgraduate admission decision or complain about an aspect of the admissions process.  Please read it carefully to make sure we have the information we need and that you are not wasting your time with an appeal that has no chance of success.",
      "The Postgraduate Admissions Office cannot provide feedback on admissions decisions, give reasons for not offering admission, nor advise you on how to improve your application. Faculties or Departments may agree to provide feedback (though they are not obliged to do so) and should be contacted directly.",
      "An admissions appeal seeks to change an outcome of the admissions process. Most often this will be an appeal to reverse the rejection of an application and have it reconsidered. However, it might also be against, for example, the imposition of a specific admission condition.",
      "A postgraduate admissions appeal can be made only in relation to one or more of the following three grounds and cannot be made on any other. Appeals that are ineligible will be dismissed.",
      "An admissions complaint is about the admissions process but seeks some other remedy than changing its outcome. An appeal made using the complaints form will be dismissed.",
      "Most admissions appeals are unsuccessful.",
      "An appeal needs substantive evidence that relates to your selected ground or grounds and you will need to show that this ground was the reason for the outcome you are appealing.  Note the following points carefully.",
      "An appeal made on this ground will be rejected if there is no good reason why these were not declared at application, regardless of the circumstances themselves.  You will need to demonstrate that significant issues affected your application and that this ‘had a material impact on the admission decision’.  As Cambridge admissions decisions look at the whole of your application, circumstances affecting just one aspect (e.g. one part of your transcript) are unlikely to have had such an impact.",
      "In general, we will not consider an admissions appeal based on circumstances or procedural issues affecting your grades in an exam.  Instead, you should use the exam mitigation, appeal or review processes in place at the institution where you take your exams (including at Cambridge) so that these circumstances are taken into account in awarding your grade.  Where such a process has not been used, you will need to explain why not.",
      "If your admissions appeal does relate to your exam performance it will, in general, only be considered once all relevant exam appeal and mitigation processes have been completed. For students taking a degree at Cambridge this will be the exam allowance or examination review process, as appropriate. In such cases, the 28-day deadline for making an admission appeal will start from the completion of the exam appeal. If you believe there are special circumstances, you should make this case in the appeal form.",

Do not use the appeal process described here to request fee status reassessment or for a fee status reassessment appeal.",

      "The postgraduate admissions process aims to identify the best and brightest students from all backgrounds through a fair, efficient and accessible process.",
      "Having a criminal conviction will not, of itself, prevent you from studying at Cambridge. However, the University has safeguarding duties towards all its students and staff and there may be occasions where these have to be placed ahead of other considerations.",
      "Therefore, in certain circumstances you must provide full details of your criminal conviction at the offer stage. This enables us to assess the risk posed to individuals and the wider University community, identifying where this risk is unacceptable or where specific actions or support are needed to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level.",
      "If you have a relevant, unspent criminal conviction you must declare this to the University when you accept your offer of admission (or if the conviction happens after this but before you matriculate, then as soon as the conviction occurs). This requirement is set out in the  Terms of Admission under ‘Unspent Criminal Convictions’.",
      "Make your declaration using the following headings.",
      "Your declaration should be sent by email to pg.criminalconvictions@admin.cam.ac.uk. This mailbox is accessible to the Head of Postgraduate Admissions and authorised staff only. The University and your College may share the information with each other.",
      "If you are uncertain whether your conviction is relevant or unspent, you should make a declaration anyway. If a conviction is determined not to be relevant or is spent then the information will not be kept on your record.",
      "From the receipt of a declaration, your offer will be placed on hold until consideration by the University is complete.",
      "Government guidance on telling an employer or university about your criminal record can be found here.",
      "A relevant criminal conviction is any that involves:",
      "Spent and unspent convictions are defined by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.The definition of spent is complex (being affected by such factors as the type of offence, the age at which the person was found guilty and the sentence received).  However, it generally means the conviction has lapsed over time and that someone is not required to declare it to an employer or university.",
      "A conviction that will be spent at the point of starting your course of study does not need to be declared unless an individual programme specifically requires it (see the information on DBS checks below).",
      "This website provides useful information on when a conviction is spent and guidance from the Ministry of Justice is available here. You might also get advice from a Citizens Advice Bureau, the Probation Service, or a solicitor (who you may have to pay). The following tables are taken from the Ministry of Justice guidance and provided for information only, the guidance should be consulted in full.",
      "* 18 and over at the time of conviction or the time the disposal is administered.\n** under 18 at the time of conviction or the time the disposal is administered.\nPeriod applies from the end date of the sentence, including the licence period.",
      "* 18 and over at the time of conviction or the time the disposal is administered.\n** under 18 at the time of conviction or the time the disposal is administered.",
      "The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 applies in England, Wales and Scotland. However, there are some differences in the way in which it operates in Scotland. Information from the Scottish Government is available here.",
      "Offences should be declared regardless of the jurisdiction of the court where you were convicted.",
      "The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 is relevant whatever your nationality or residence, and the concept of spent convictions, described above, applies regardless of the jurisdiction of the court where you were convicted.  The basic principle is that the timescales for a conviction to become spent that is set out in the Act also applies in such cases. Specifically, the Act states that:",
      "If you require or are extending a visa then you must also declare any unspent criminal convictions as part of your visa application and this declaration may lead to refusal of your application. For information see the UK Government immigration rules.",
      "If you fail to disclose a relevant, unspent conviction, the University may withdraw your application, including if you have received an unconditional offer, at any time up to matriculation. If your application is not withdrawn, the procedures detailed below will be followed.",
      "If you have matriculated before the failure to disclose a conviction is discovered, the University will take disciplinary action which may lead to the termination of your studies. If necessary, the University will take immediate action to withdraw you from the University or exclude or suspend you.",
      "There is an additional process of checks and consideration for applicants to certain programmes which are exempt from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. This applies in particular, but is not limited to, courses in Education and Medicine or where research involves contact with children or vulnerable adults. These checks are made by obtaining a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) certificate for UK students and the same or an equivalent certificate for overseas students.",
      "Your department will determine whether such a check is needed and, if it is, then satisfactory completion of the DBS process will become a condition of your offer. The DBS process is managed by Student Registry, working with departments, and is separate from the criminal conviction process described here. Where a DBS check is made, the requirement for declaring a criminal conviction still applies and any declaration will be considered through the Criminal Conviction Declaration Community outlined below. This will occur in parallel with consideration of a positive DBS disclosure through the relevant University panel and information will be shared with those conducting the DBS process.",
      "If you go on to matriculate and become a registered Student, declaring an existing conviction at application using the process described here will have discharged your responsibility under (1)(c) of the Student Disciplinary Framework.",
      "If you receive a conviction which is relevant and unspent after you have become a registered Student then you will need to declare it to the University under section 6 of the Student Disciplinary Framework.",
      "The Postgraduate Admissions Office will ask you to provide as much information as possible about the nature and context of the offence(s) concerned, by completing a standard form. In particular, you will be asked to provide:",
      "It may be necessary for the University to approach third parties for this or additional information. Your consent will always be obtained before contacting third parties about a declared conviction(s).",
      "The Head of Postgraduate Admissions will conduct a risk assessment based on the documentation received, taking into account factors including:",
      "If your case is determined to be low risk, this assessment will be referred to the Admissions Standing Committee on Criminal Conviction Declarations for confirmation. If confirmed, you will be informed and your offer will proceed as normal.",
      "If your case is determined to be medium or high risk then it will be referred to the Admissions Standing Committee on Criminal Conviction Declarations for consideration and, if needed, further information will be sought. All convictions that have resulted in a sentence of imprisonment (including a suspended sentence) will be considered at least medium risk and referred to the Standing Committee. Your offer will remain on hold until the Standing Committee has come to a final decision.",
      "The Standing Committee comprises three to five senior members of the University. The Committee may also invite a representative of the relevant department, the relevant College and the Legal Services Division, and it may call on external expertise where required.",
      "Based on the documentation gathered, the Standing Committee will review the risk assessment conducted by the Head of Postgraduate Admissions. It will take into account the factors listed above and consider the risk that your admission might pose to other members of your College, department or faculty and the wider University community.",
      "The Standing Committee will make one of the following decisions:",
      "The first two of the decisions above (that is that your offer can proceed) also depend on you receiving a College place. If the Standing Committee decides that your offer should proceed, it will recommend this to your College. However, Colleges are independent bodies and may decide not to make, or continue with, the offer of a place.",
      "Note that these processes cannot guarantee that a College place is found. Should this happen, your case will return to the Standing Committee and your offer of a place at the University will be withdrawn.",
      "The Head of Postgraduate Admissions will tell you the Standing Committee’s final decision, following College consideration where relevant.",
      "If your offer is confirmed, the Standing Committee will determine who, if anyone, within the University or an associated institution (such as an industry placement provider) should be given information about your conviction. This will only be done in order to support you and/or to protect other students and staff. Your consent to this will be a condition of your admission.",
      "Timescales cannot be given for individual cases as circumstances will vary.  The University will aim to deal with your case promptly, but will not compromise on its own process of assurance.  In some cases, completing the process may require you to defer entry between terms or to reapply in the following year.  This is more likely to be the case for courses where the start date is relatively soon after offers are made, e.g. some MSt courses.",
      "If you do not comply in full with admission requirements set in light of your criminal conviction, including providing requested information, the University will have the right to cancel your application.",
      "All records and correspondence relating to you declaring a relevant criminal conviction will be securely stored in accordance with the University’s Data Protection Policy.",
      "The University and your College will share information with each other only as is necessary. It may also be necessary for the University to approach third parties for information as part of the risk assessment process. You will be informed before this takes place.",

      "The postgraduate admissions process aims to identify the best and brightest students from all backgrounds through a fair, efficient and accessible process.",
      "Having a criminal conviction will not, of itself, prevent you from studying at Cambridge. However, the University has safeguarding duties towards all its students and staff and there may be occasions where these have to be placed ahead of other considerations.",
      "Therefore, in certain circumstances you must provide full details of your criminal conviction at the offer stage. This enables us to assess the risk posed to individuals and the wider University community, identifying where this risk is unacceptable or where specific actions or support are needed to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level.",
      "If you have a relevant, unspent criminal conviction you must declare this to the University when you accept your offer of admission (or if the conviction happens after this but before you matriculate, then as soon as the conviction occurs). This requirement is set out in the  Terms of Admission under ‘Unspent Criminal Convictions’.",
      "Make your declaration using the following headings.",
      "Your declaration should be sent by email to pg.criminalconvictions@admin.cam.ac.uk. This mailbox is accessible to the Head of Postgraduate Admissions and authorised staff only. The University and your College may share the information with each other.",
      "If you are uncertain whether your conviction is relevant or unspent, you should make a declaration anyway. If a conviction is determined not to be relevant or is spent then the information will not be kept on your record.",
      "From the receipt of a declaration, your offer will be placed on hold until consideration by the University is complete.",
      "Government guidance on telling an employer or university about your criminal record can be found here.",
      "A relevant criminal conviction is any that involves:",
      "Spent and unspent convictions are defined by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.The definition of spent is complex (being affected by such factors as the type of offence, the age at which the person was found guilty and the sentence received).  However, it generally means the conviction has lapsed over time and that someone is not required to declare it to an employer or university.",
      "A conviction that will be spent at the point of starting your course of study does not need to be declared unless an individual programme specifically requires it (see the information on DBS checks below).",
      "This website provides useful information on when a conviction is spent and guidance from the Ministry of Justice is available here. You might also get advice from a Citizens Advice Bureau, the Probation Service, or a solicitor (who you may have to pay). The following tables are taken from the Ministry of Justice guidance and provided for information only, the guidance should be consulted in full.",

      "* 18 and over at the time of conviction or the time the disposal is administered.\n** under 18 at the time of conviction or the time the disposal is administered.",
      "The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 applies in England, Wales and Scotland. However, there are some differences in the way in which it operates in Scotland. Information from the Scottish Government is available here.",
      "Offences should be declared regardless of the jurisdiction of the court where you were convicted.",
      "The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 is relevant whatever your nationality or residence, and the concept of spent convictions, described above, applies regardless of the jurisdiction of the court where you were convicted.  The basic principle is that the timescales for a conviction to become spent that is set out in the Act also applies in such cases. Specifically, the Act states that:",
      "If you require or are extending a visa then you must also declare any unspent criminal convictions as part of your visa application and this declaration may lead to refusal of your application. For information see the UK Government immigration rules.",
      "If you fail to disclose a relevant, unspent conviction, the University may withdraw your application, including if you have received an unconditional offer, at any time up to matriculation. If your application is not withdrawn, the procedures detailed below will be followed.",
      "If you have matriculated before the failure to disclose a conviction is discovered, the University will take disciplinary action which may lead to the termination of your studies. If necessary, the University will take immediate action to withdraw you from the University or exclude or suspend you.",
      "There is an additional process of checks and consideration for applicants to certain programmes which are exempt from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. This applies in particular, but is not limited to, courses in Education and Medicine or where research involves contact with children or vulnerable adults. These checks are made by obtaining a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) certificate for UK students and the same or an equivalent certificate for overseas students.",
      "Your department will determine whether such a check is needed and, if it is, then satisfactory completion of the DBS process will become a condition of your offer. The DBS process is managed by Student Registry, working with departments, and is separate from the criminal conviction process described here. Where a DBS check is made, the requirement for declaring a criminal conviction still applies and any declaration will be considered through the Criminal Conviction Declaration Community outlined below. This will occur in parallel with consideration of a positive DBS disclosure through the relevant University panel and information will be shared with those conducting the DBS process.",
      "If you go on to matriculate and become a registered Student, declaring an existing conviction at application using the process described here will have discharged your responsibility under (1)(c) of the Student Disciplinary Framework.",
      "If you receive a conviction which is relevant and unspent after you have become a registered Student then you will need to declare it to the University under section 6 of the Student Disciplinary Framework.",
      "The Postgraduate Admissions Office will ask you to provide as much information as possible about the nature and context of the offence(s) concerned, by completing a standard form. In particular, you will be asked to provide:",
      "It may be necessary for the University to approach third parties for this or additional information. Your consent will always be obtained before contacting third parties about a declared conviction(s).",
      "The Head of Postgraduate Admissions will conduct a risk assessment based on the documentation received, taking into account factors including:",
      "If your case is determined to be low risk, this assessment will be referred to the Admissions Standing Committee on Criminal Conviction Declarations for confirmation. If confirmed, you will be informed and your offer will proceed as normal.",
      "If your case is determined to be medium or high risk then it will be referred to the Admissions Standing Committee on Criminal Conviction Declarations for consideration and, if needed, further information will be sought. All convictions that have resulted in a sentence of imprisonment (including a suspended sentence) will be considered at least medium risk and referred to the Standing Committee. Your offer will remain on hold until the Standing Committee has come to a final decision.",
      "The Standing Committee comprises three to five senior members of the University. The Committee may also invite a representative of the relevant department, the relevant College and the Legal Services Division, and it may call on external expertise where required.",
      "Based on the documentation gathered, the Standing Committee will review the risk assessment conducted by the Head of Postgraduate Admissions. It will take into account the factors listed above and consider the risk that your admission might pose to other members of your College, department or faculty and the wider University community.",
      "The Standing Committee will make one of the following decisions:",
      "The first two of the decisions above (that is that your offer can proceed) also depend on you receiving a College place. If the Standing Committee decides that your offer should proceed, it will recommend this to your College. However, Colleges are independent bodies and may decide not to make, or continue with, the offer of a place.",
      "Note that these processes cannot guarantee that a College place is found. Should this happen, your case will return to the Standing Committee and your offer of a place at the University will be withdrawn.",
      "The Head of Postgraduate Admissions will tell you the Standing Committee’s final decision, following College consideration where relevant.",
      "If your offer is confirmed, the Standing Committee will determine who, if anyone, within the University or an associated institution (such as an industry placement provider) should be given information about your conviction. This will only be done in order to support you and/or to protect other students and staff. Your consent to this will be a condition of your admission.",
      "Timescales cannot be given for individual cases as circumstances will vary.  The University will aim to deal with your case promptly, but will not compromise on its own process of assurance.  In some cases, completing the process may require you to defer entry between terms or to reapply in the following year.  This is more likely to be the case for courses where the start date is relatively soon after offers are made, e.g. some MSt courses.",
      "If you do not comply in full with admission requirements set in light of your criminal conviction, including providing requested information, the University will have the right to cancel your application.",
      "All records and correspondence relating to you declaring a relevant criminal conviction will be securely stored in accordance with the University’s Data Protection Policy.",
      "The University and your College will share information with each other only as is necessary. It may also be necessary for the University to approach third parties for information as part of the risk assessment process. You will be informed before this takes place.",

      "Your department will determine whether such a check is needed and, if it is, then satisfactory completion of the DBS process will become a condition of your offer. The DBS process is managed by Student Registry, working with departments, and is separate from the criminal conviction process described here. Where a DBS check is made, the requirement for declaring a criminal conviction still applies and any declaration will be considered through the Criminal Conviction Declaration Community outlined below. This will occur in parallel with consideration of a positive DBS disclosure through the relevant University panel and information will be shared with those conducting the DBS process.",
      "If you go on to matriculate and become a registered Student, declaring an existing conviction at application using the process described here will have discharged your responsibility under (1)(c) of the Student Disciplinary Framework.",
      "If you receive a conviction which is relevant and unspent after you have become a registered Student then you will need to declare it to the University under section 6 of the Student Disciplinary Framework.",

      "If your case is determined to be medium or high risk then it will be referred to the Admissions Standing Committee on Criminal Conviction Declarations for consideration and, if needed, further information will be sought. All convictions that have resulted in a sentence of imprisonment (including a suspended sentence) will be considered at least medium risk and referred to the Standing Committee. Your offer will remain on hold until the Standing Committee has come to a final decision.",
      "The Standing Committee comprises three to five senior members of the University. The Committee may also invite a representative of the relevant department, the relevant College and the Legal Services Division, and it may call on external expertise where required.",
      "Based on the documentation gathered, the Standing Committee will review the risk assessment conducted by the Head of Postgraduate Admissions. It will take into account the factors listed above and consider the risk that your admission might pose to other members of your College, department or faculty and the wider University community.",
      "The Standing Committee will make one of the following decisions:",
      "The first two of the decisions above (that is that your offer can proceed) also depend on you receiving a College place. If the Standing Committee decides that your offer should proceed, it will recommend this to your College. However, Colleges are independent bodies and may decide not to make, or continue with, the offer of a place.",
      "Note that these processes cannot guarantee that a College place is found. Should this happen, your case will return to the Standing Committee and your offer of a place at the University will be withdrawn.",
      "The Head of Postgraduate Admissions will tell you the Standing Committee’s final decision, following College consideration where relevant.",
      "If your offer is confirmed, the Standing Committee will determine who, if anyone, within the University or an associated institution (such as an industry placement provider) should be given information about your conviction. This will only be done in order to support you and/or to protect other students and staff. Your consent to this will be a condition of your admission.",
      "Timescales cannot be given for individual cases as circumstances will vary.  The University will aim to deal with your case promptly, but will not compromise on its own process of assurance.  In some cases, completing the process may require you to defer entry between terms or to reapply in the following year.  This is more likely to be the case for courses where the start date is relatively soon after offers are made, e.g. some MSt courses.",
      "If you do not comply in full with admission requirements set in light of your criminal conviction, including providing requested information, the University will have the right to cancel your application.",
      "All records and correspondence relating to you declaring a relevant criminal conviction will be securely stored in accordance with the University’s Data Protection Policy.",
      "The University and your College will share information with each other only as is necessary. It may also be necessary for the University to approach third parties for information as part of the risk assessment process. You will be informed before this takes place.",

      "Having a criminal conviction will not, of itself, prevent you from studying at Cambridge. However, the University has safeguarding duties towards all its students and staff and there may be occasions where these have to be placed ahead of other considerations.",
      "Therefore, in certain circumstances you must provide full details of your criminal conviction at the offer stage. This enables us to assess the risk posed to individuals and the wider University community, identifying where this risk is unacceptable or where specific actions or support are needed to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level.",
      "If you have a relevant, unspent criminal conviction you must declare this to the University when you accept your offer of admission (or if the conviction happens after this but before you matriculate, then as soon as the conviction occurs). This requirement is set out in the  Terms of Admission under ‘Unspent Criminal Convictions’.",
      "Make your declaration using the following headings.",
      "Your declaration should be sent by email to pg.criminalconvictions@admin.cam.ac.uk. This mailbox is accessible to the Head of Postgraduate Admissions and authorised staff only. The University and your College may share the information with each other.",
      "If you are uncertain whether your conviction is relevant or unspent, you should make a declaration anyway. If a conviction is determined not to be relevant or is spent then the information will not be kept on your record.",
      "From the receipt of a declaration, your offer will be placed on hold until consideration by the University is complete.",
      "Government guidance on telling an employer or university about your criminal record can be found here.",
      "A relevant criminal conviction is any that involves:",
      "Spent and unspent convictions are defined by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.The definition of spent is complex (being affected by such factors as the type of offence, the age at which the person was found guilty and the sentence received).  However, it generally means the conviction has lapsed over time and that someone is not required to declare it to an employer or university.",
      "A conviction that will be spent at the point of starting your course of study does not need to be declared unless an individual programme specifically requires it (see the information on DBS checks below).",
      "This website provides useful information on when a conviction is spent and guidance from the Ministry of Justice is available here. You might also get advice from a Citizens Advice Bureau, the Probation Service, or a solicitor (who you may have to pay). The following tables are taken from the Ministry of Justice guidance and provided for information only, the guidance should be consulted in full.",

      "Offences should be declared regardless of the jurisdiction of the court where you were convicted.",
      "The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 is relevant whatever your nationality or residence, and the concept of spent convictions, described above, applies regardless of the jurisdiction of the court where you were convicted.  The basic principle is that the timescales for a conviction to become spent that is set out in the Act also applies in such cases. Specifically, the Act states that:",

      "If you have matriculated before the failure to disclose a conviction is discovered, the University will take disciplinary action which may lead to the termination of your studies. If necessary, the University will take immediate action to withdraw you from the University or exclude or suspend you.",
      "There is an additional process of checks and consideration for applicants to certain programmes which are exempt from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. This applies in particular, but is not limited to, courses in Education and Medicine or where research involves contact with children or vulnerable adults. These checks are made by obtaining a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) certificate for UK students and the same or an equivalent certificate for overseas students.",

      "Having a criminal conviction will not, of itself, prevent you from studying at Cambridge. However, the University has safeguarding duties towards all its students and staff and there may be occasions where these have to be placed ahead of other considerations.",
      "Therefore, in certain circumstances you must provide full details of your criminal conviction at the offer stage. This enables us to assess the risk posed to individuals and the wider University community, identifying where this risk is unacceptable or where specific actions or support are needed to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level.",
      "If you have a relevant, unspent criminal conviction you must declare this to the University when you accept your offer of admission (or if the conviction happens after this but before you matriculate, then as soon as the conviction occurs). This requirement is set out in the  Terms of Admission under ‘Unspent Criminal Convictions’.",
      "Make your declaration using the following headings.",
      "Your declaration should be sent by email to pg.criminalconvictions@admin.cam.ac.uk. This mailbox is accessible to the Head of Postgraduate Admissions and authorised staff only. The University and your College may share the information with each other.",
      "If you are uncertain whether your conviction is relevant or unspent, you should make a declaration anyway. If a conviction is determined not to be relevant or is spent then the information will not be kept on your record.",
      "From the receipt of a declaration, your offer will be placed on hold until consideration by the University is complete.",
      "Government guidance on telling an employer or university about your criminal record can be found here.",
      "A relevant criminal conviction is any that involves:",
      "Spent and unspent convictions are defined by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.The definition of spent is complex (being affected by such factors as the type of offence, the age at which the person was found guilty and the sentence received).  However, it generally means the conviction has lapsed over time and that someone is not required to declare it to an employer or university.",
      "A conviction that will be spent at the point of starting your course of study does not need to be declared unless an individual programme specifically requires it (see the information on DBS checks below).",
      "This website provides useful information on when a conviction is spent and guidance from the Ministry of Justice is available here. You might also get advice from a Citizens Advice Bureau, the Probation Service, or a solicitor (who you may have to pay). The following tables are taken from the Ministry of Justice guidance and provided for information only, the guidance should be consulted in full.",
      "* 18 and over at the time of conviction or the time the disposal is administered.\n** under 18 at the time of conviction or the time the disposal is administered.\nPeriod applies from the end date of the sentence, including the licence period.",
      "* 18 and over at the time of conviction or the time the disposal is administered.\n** under 18 at the time of conviction or the time the disposal is administered.",
      "The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 applies in England, Wales and Scotland. However, there are some differences in the way in which it operates in Scotland. Information from the Scottish Government is available here.",
      "Offences should be declared regardless of the jurisdiction of the court where you were convicted.",
      "The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 is relevant whatever your nationality or residence, and the concept of spent convictions, described above, applies regardless of the jurisdiction of the court where you were convicted.  The basic principle is that the timescales for a conviction to become spent that is set out in the Act also applies in such cases. Specifically, the Act states that:",
      "If you require or are extending a visa then you must also declare any unspent criminal convictions as part of your visa application and this declaration may lead to refusal of your application. For information see the UK Government immigration rules.",
      "If you fail to disclose a relevant, unspent conviction, the University may withdraw your application, including if you have received an unconditional offer, at any time up to matriculation. If your application is not withdrawn, the procedures detailed below will be followed.",
      "If you have matriculated before the failure to disclose a conviction is discovered, the University will take disciplinary action which may lead to the termination of your studies. If necessary, the University will take immediate action to withdraw you from the University or exclude or suspend you.",
      "There is an additional process of checks and consideration for applicants to certain programmes which are exempt from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. This applies in particular, but is not limited to, courses in Education and Medicine or where research involves contact with children or vulnerable adults. These checks are made by obtaining a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) certificate for UK students and the same or an equivalent certificate for overseas students.",
      "Your department will determine whether such a check is needed and, if it is, then satisfactory completion of the DBS process will become a condition of your offer. The DBS process is managed by Student Registry, working with departments, and is separate from the criminal conviction process described here. Where a DBS check is made, the requirement for declaring a criminal conviction still applies and any declaration will be considered through the Criminal Conviction Declaration Community outlined below. This will occur in parallel with consideration of a positive DBS disclosure through the relevant University panel and information will be shared with those conducting the DBS process.",
      "If you go on to matriculate and become a registered Student, declaring an existing conviction at application using the process described here will have discharged your responsibility under (1)(c) of the Student Disciplinary Framework.",
      "If you receive a conviction which is relevant and unspent after you have become a registered Student then you will need to declare it to the University under section 6 of the Student Disciplinary Framework.",
      "The Postgraduate Admissions Office will ask you to provide as much information as possible about the nature and context of the offence(s) concerned, by completing a standard form. In particular, you will be asked to provide:",
      "It may be necessary for the University to approach third parties for this or additional information. Your consent will always be obtained before contacting third parties about a declared conviction(s).",
      "The Head of Postgraduate Admissions will conduct a risk assessment based on the documentation received, taking into account factors including:",
      "If your case is determined to be low risk, this assessment will be referred to the Admissions Standing Committee on Criminal Conviction Declarations for confirmation. If confirmed, you will be informed and your offer will proceed as normal.",
      "If your case is determined to be medium or high risk then it will be referred to the Admissions Standing Committee on Criminal Conviction Declarations for consideration and, if needed, further information will be sought. All convictions that have resulted in a sentence of imprisonment (including a suspended sentence) will be considered at least medium risk and referred to the Standing Committee. Your offer will remain on hold until the Standing Committee has come to a final decision.",
      "The Standing Committee comprises three to five senior members of the University. The Committee may also invite a representative of the relevant department, the relevant College and the Legal Services Division, and it may call on external expertise where required.",
      "Based on the documentation gathered, the Standing Committee will review the risk assessment conducted by the Head of Postgraduate Admissions. It will take into account the factors listed above and consider the risk that your admission might pose to other members of your College, department or faculty and the wider University community.",
      "The Standing Committee will make one of the following decisions:",
      "The first two of the decisions above (that is that your offer can proceed) also depend on you receiving a College place. If the Standing Committee decides that your offer should proceed, it will recommend this to your College. However, Colleges are independent bodies and may decide not to make, or continue with, the offer of a place.",
      "Note that these processes cannot guarantee that a College place is found. Should this happen, your case will return to the Standing Committee and your offer of a place at the University will be withdrawn.",
      "The Head of Postgraduate Admissions will tell you the Standing Committee’s final decision, following College consideration where relevant.",
      "If your offer is confirmed, the Standing Committee will determine who, if anyone, within the University or an associated institution (such as an industry placement provider) should be given information about your conviction. This will only be done in order to support you and/or to protect other students and staff. Your consent to this will be a condition of your admission.",
      "Timescales cannot be given for individual cases as circumstances will vary.  The University will aim to deal with your case promptly, but will not compromise on its own process of assurance.  In some cases, completing the process may require you to defer entry between terms or to reapply in the following year.  This is more likely to be the case for courses where the start date is relatively soon after offers are made, e.g. some MSt courses.",
      "If you do not comply in full with admission requirements set in light of your criminal conviction, including providing requested information, the University will have the right to cancel your application.",
      "All records and correspondence relating to you declaring a relevant criminal conviction will be securely stored in accordance with the University’s Data Protection Policy.",
      "The University and your College will share information with each other only as is necessary. It may also be necessary for the University to approach third parties for information as part of the risk assessment process. You will be informed before this takes place.",
      "Any documentation relating to your conviction will be stored securely and separately from other student records. Access will be restricted to the Head of Postgraduate Admissions (or their delegate) only.",
      "The University will determine who, if anyone, within the University or an associated institution (such as an industry placement provider) should be given information about your conviction to support you and/or protect other students and staff. You will be informed before this takes place.",
      "Your documentation will be retained for six years following your graduation or departure. It will then be destroyed in line with the University’s records retention schedule.",
      "The Postgraduate Admissions Office will keep a copy of the information relating to your conviction and this will be securely stored for a period of one year after the admissions cycle has ended, at which point all electronic and paper files will be deleted.",

      "The most exciting thing about Cambridge is the legacy of science and seeing how it carries on today. The network of talent is unique, and you’re surrounded by it. Cambridge is a hub of innovation, not only in fields like technology, health, and quantum physics, but it’s also a hub for some of the biggest pharma and software companies in the world, so it’s a great place to work on translational research.",
      "I was looking at British universities for my PhD, and, for me, Cambridge was the best place for multidisciplinary biomedical engineering. It was where I liked the labs the most. I joined the Chemistry department, but because of the academic freedom Cambridge offers, and with my supervisor’s support, I’ve been able to collaborate very well with other teams and departments. My collaboration with the Biochemistry department looks at the single-cell electron-generating behaviour of micro-organisms that have the ability to harvest sunlight and carbon dioxide, their potential to be harvested as a power source. I’ve also collaborated with Electrical Engineering, working on developing cell-friendly materials which are also electrically active, paving the way for a more biologically relevant bio-electronic study platform for cells. I’ve been able to do a lot of things I might have otherwise not been able to.",
      "My initial exposure to science came from my father, who studied molecular genetics. My mum has always been the artist and my creativity comes from her side. At school I enjoyed science projects and I began to think that doing research might suit me.",
      "Cambridge is the third phase of my academic journey. I studied Biomedical Engineering for my undergraduate degree, at Osmania University and the University of California Riverside (UCR). It opened the door in terms of research, and thinking about how I could work on applied engineering. I did my Master’s in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, and while I was there I was able to volunteer with a public health NGO.",
      "For my PhD, I had always wanted to be involved in topics related to health and human life. I wanted to learn how to conduct research and be trained in asking the right questions and continue learning. Cambridge is a huge learning curve, but it means you become a much more independent researcher. There is a lot of problem solving, and there is a lot of support available through the interdisciplinary teams.",
      "When I was applying to Cambridge I found a lot of information online – on the department pages, on the labs’ pages, and on the pages of individual lab members. I actually applied to three different departments, because all of them were involved in the work I wanted to do. And I had a number of phone and video calls with professors in those departments who were extremely friendly and very helpful.",
      "My funding came from Gates Cambridge Trust which oversees the Gates Cambridge scholarship programme for international postgraduate students. It is very flexible in terms of the scope of your study. I applied for it when I applied to the department, and the programme itself is actually one of my biggest sources of support and community here. I feel very thankful for that - the international aspect, the fact that there are students from diverse backgrounds and many countries. The fact there is such a big international community somehow makes me feel closer to home.",
      "Cambridge is a completely different experience to anything I’ve had before, especially the college aspect of life. Because you’re part of a college community, you get to meet people from different departments and have really nice experiences, like picnics on the grass, conversations with people you might not have otherwise met. There is a lot of support.  Life during the pandemic is a challenge, but I think the University has been doing everything it can to keep us safe.",
      "I’m really glad I came to Murray Edwards because I’m a huge supporter of women in education, particularly STEM. I’ve been involved with the college’s student committee, and have been its president. I’ve had an opportunity to do lots of other things in Cambridge, around science and policy, around student organisations, around the commercialisation of research work. It’s been really incredible.",
      "My advice to anyone else applying is to reach out to people and see where you fit. The biggest benefit is really the way Cambridge is set up, because you’re not just restricted to your own department. You get the opportunity to meet people from across the university. Having a PhD from Cambridge is going to open that initial door to let you go and pursue whatever you want. That could be securing a position within a company – firms specifically come to Cambridge to hire Cambridge graduates – or it could be postdoc opportunities, funding opportunities, research collaborations, or exposure. It’s a legacy you can bank on.",

      "Akhila, from Hyderabad, India, is a PhD candidate at Murray Edwards College. Based in the Department of Chemistry, her research focuses on the electrical interactions within living systems at a cellular level",
      "The most exciting thing about Cambridge is the legacy of science and seeing how it carries on today. The network of talent is unique, and you’re surrounded by it. Cambridge is a hub of innovation, not only in fields like technology, health, and quantum physics, but it’s also a hub for some of the biggest pharma and software companies in the world, so it’s a great place to work on translational research.",
      "I was looking at British universities for my PhD, and, for me, Cambridge was the best place for multidisciplinary biomedical engineering. It was where I liked the labs the most. I joined the Chemistry department, but because of the academic freedom Cambridge offers, and with my supervisor’s support, I’ve been able to collaborate very well with other teams and departments. My collaboration with the Biochemistry department looks at the single-cell electron-generating behaviour of micro-organisms that have the ability to harvest sunlight and carbon dioxide, their potential to be harvested as a power source. I’ve also collaborated with Electrical Engineering, working on developing cell-friendly materials which are also electrically active, paving the way for a more biologically relevant bio-electronic study platform for cells. I’ve been able to do a lot of things I might have otherwise not been able to.",
      "My initial exposure to science came from my father, who studied molecular genetics. My mum has always been the artist and my creativity comes from her side. At school I enjoyed science projects and I began to think that doing research might suit me.",
      "Cambridge is the third phase of my academic journey. I studied Biomedical Engineering for my undergraduate degree, at Osmania University and the University of California Riverside (UCR). It opened the door in terms of research, and thinking about how I could work on applied engineering. I did my Master’s in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, and while I was there I was able to volunteer with a public health NGO.",
      "For my PhD, I had always wanted to be involved in topics related to health and human life. I wanted to learn how to conduct research and be trained in asking the right questions and continue learning. Cambridge is a huge learning curve, but it means you become a much more independent researcher. There is a lot of problem solving, and there is a lot of support available through the interdisciplinary teams.",
      "When I was applying to Cambridge I found a lot of information online – on the department pages, on the labs’ pages, and on the pages of individual lab members. I actually applied to three different departments, because all of them were involved in the work I wanted to do. And I had a number of phone and video calls with professors in those departments who were extremely friendly and very helpful.",
      "My funding came from Gates Cambridge Trust which oversees the Gates Cambridge scholarship programme for international postgraduate students. It is very flexible in terms of the scope of your study. I applied for it when I applied to the department, and the programme itself is actually one of my biggest sources of support and community here. I feel very thankful for that - the international aspect, the fact that there are students from diverse backgrounds and many countries. The fact there is such a big international community somehow makes me feel closer to home.",
      "Cambridge is a completely different experience to anything I’ve had before, especially the college aspect of life. Because you’re part of a college community, you get to meet people from different departments and have really nice experiences, like picnics on the grass, conversations with people you might not have otherwise met. There is a lot of support.  Life during the pandemic is a challenge, but I think the University has been doing everything it can to keep us safe.",
      "I’m really glad I came to Murray Edwards because I’m a huge supporter of women in education, particularly STEM. I’ve been involved with the college’s student committee, and have been its president. I’ve had an opportunity to do lots of other things in Cambridge, around science and policy, around student organisations, around the commercialisation of research work. It’s been really incredible.",
      "My advice to anyone else applying is to reach out to people and see where you fit. The biggest benefit is really the way Cambridge is set up, because you’re not just restricted to your own department. You get the opportunity to meet people from across the university. Having a PhD from Cambridge is going to open that initial door to let you go and pursue whatever you want. That could be securing a position within a company – firms specifically come to Cambridge to hire Cambridge graduates – or it could be postdoc opportunities, funding opportunities, research collaborations, or exposure. It’s a legacy you can bank on.",

      "Alex, from California, chose to study for an MPhil degree in Physics at Churchill College. Based in the NanoPhotonics Centre, his research focuses on light and nanotechnology",
      "Cambridge is such a unique place to study and to do research. It’s got a great community and you’re always interacting and making connections with different people - from different fields and from lots of different countries. I feel like I get to learn something or to solve something every day.",
      "As a researcher, a lot of your happiness and satisfaction comes from your work, and at Cambridge my research group has really reinvigorated my enthusiasm for science. People are happy in general and that makes such a difference - they’re enthusiastic and energetic about the science.",
      "Cambridge University is one of the best academic institutions in the world, and the quality of learning is excellent. Since school my academic interests have been around science and physics. And Cambridge, in particular the Cavendish Laboratory, is a huge part of the story of physics. Initially, I was daunted by the University’s academic reputation, but the people here are so kind and helpful. Before you come to Cambridge you only really know it for its big reputation, but you get here and you find it’s a warm and welcoming place with a really collaborative atmosphere. I went from imposter syndrome to feeling like this place was my second home!",
      "The focus of my work is nanoscience and the study of light. Throughout history, light has been a key tool in helping us understand the world. I’m using it to see what’s going on at a cellular level. I’m fascinated by light, and the potential to use it in all sorts of new ways - in place of circuits or electrical systems, for example.",
      "My undergraduate degree was in Physics and Electrical Engineering. I studied at Rice University in Texas, and that’s where I started my research. After that I really wanted to experience doing research full time, and not having to worry about classes. That’s why the MPhil at Cambridge is really unique – it’s one of the only degrees at Master’s level which lets you do that. I wanted to come to Cambridge for a year to grow as a scientist and develop a more mature vision before going on to a PhD. It’s been about learning to make decisions independently, which can be a hard thing to learn, but it’s been a huge benefit.",
      "When I was first looking into studying at Cambridge I found a lot of information online - on the University website, reading blogs, watching videos on YouTube. There’s actually more funding available than people realise. My funding came from the Churchill Scholarship, which sends US students to study at Churchill College every year.",
      "Being a Master’s student at Cambridge means that as well as being a researcher at a university you’re also a part of the whole community because of the college system. Everyone’s living in the same area, so you’re not completely separate from undergraduates and other postgraduates.",
      "The traditions here will be some of my fondest memories  – cycling every day gives me so much joy, and being part of the Formals [traditional dinners] with so many other people is really special. It’s amazing to experience that side of Cambridge. And the extracurricular side of things is really vibrant too. Music is such a big part of my life - I play the viola, and there aren’t a lot of violists in general, so musical groups always need a viola! I’ve played in a lot of different groups across Cambridge, from accompanying choirs to playing in musical theatres.",
      "This is my first time in England, and I’ve had the most wonderful year at Cambridge - even with the pandemic. The College has been supportive and I’ve also been impressed with how my department handled the lockdown. It was operational again as soon as possible, and that’s a testament to the organisation here. I’ve felt very safe with the all the precautions, and happy that I could get back to my research so soon.",
      "Coming here has given me so many more connections to researchers and collaborations in Europe, and in general, and having Cambridge on my CV will be absolutely fantastic and help me stand out back in the US. But it’s also about being around these incredible people who push you to keep growing and progressing.",

      "Huijie, from China, is a PhD candidate at Trinity College. Based in the Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, her research focuses on myocardial regeneration",
      "I clicked with the professors here – that’s why I chose Cambridge for my PhD. I had considered a lot of universities in the application phase; I already had a research programme in mind, so I looked at different research groups in similar fields and talked to them. I wanted to find out which one I would enjoy the most, and it was Cambridge.",
      "It only takes 3-4 years, ideally, to finish a PhD programme in the UK, which is shorter than most countries. I also wanted to live in the UK and experience the culture. I already had some friends studying here, and when I asked them about their experience they said the main concern was the weather! Cambridge is a big name in the world, it’s one of the top ranked universities and has an incredible reputation. Stephen Hawking is my favourite scientist of all time, and you only need to look at all the Nobel Prize winners who were at Cambridge to know it’s a special place.",
      "When I was applying to study at Cambridge, the first thing I looked at was the university website, and the links to pages specifically for postgraduate programmes. There’s a lot of information about what the requirements are, and the documents you need to submit, and most importantly the deadlines for submitting them. I also emailed the department and the admissions team with some questions and they came back to me quickly.",
      "As an undergraduate I studied Engineering, specialising in Materials Science, at Central South University and Monash University. My PhD at Cambridge focuses on myocardial regeneration. There is a lot of support in my team and in the department. People are really friendly, and there’s no such thing as a silly question. You don’t have to be perfect; the most important thing is to take the initiative and not be afraid to reach out. You just need to be ready to contribute and discuss, and have ideas.",
      "I’m funded by the Cambridge Trust, which pays for my University fees, and the China Scholarship Council, which pays for my living costs. My advice would be to secure your funding as soon as possible, because there are deadlines and it’s quite competitive.",
      "Cambridge is a lovely city. Most of my social life revolves around my college and I’ve been taken really good care of.  If you keep your eyes open there are lots of opportunities – there are Formals [traditional dinners] every week, and it’s a good break from the lab and a chance to chat to people from different departments, including students and Fellows. There are bar nights and cycle trips to Grantchester. I’ve also joined the Cambridge Union and have enjoyed the debates. That’s the thing I love about Cambridge – all these little traditions that I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to experience. It’s a lot of fun.",
      "I stayed in college accommodation during the pandemic lockdown, and there was a lot support and help, such as a ‘buddy system’ for those who needed to self-isolate. Plenty of safety measures have been put in place so I feel safe here. The department I work in has also introduced layers of precautions.",
      "Cambridge opens up so many possibilities. The university careers service is also a huge benefit, and the network of alumni is extraordinary. There are opportunities to attend workshops to explore your future career options, to modify your CV for specific job applications, and to even do mock interviews if you wish.",

      "Kelsey, from Boston in the United States, is a PhD candidate at Hughes Hall. Based in the Faculty of Education, her research focuses on the role of play in paediatric healthcare, with a specific interest in children’s own perspectives of play during hospitalisation.",
      "I had spent five years in the working world between by Master’s and my PhD, and throughout that time I developed a strong conceptualisation of what I wanted to focus on for doctoral level research. Cambridge not only had an open scholarship opportunity through the Cambridge Trust and LEGO Foundation, but I also identified a supervisor that really suited my area of interest - these were the two most critical components for me in choosing where to pursue further graduate study.",
      "I had been looking at PhD programmes for a while and was particularly interested in returning to a UK university as they tend to be more independent and project focused, as well as shorter term. My background is in psychology and child development and I was most concerned with finding a suitable research programme that would allow me to work with children.",
      "As an undergraduate I studied Psychology at Boston University, and through that degree I had the opportunity to spend time in London on a study abroad internship programme. I interned with a Play Specialist team on a paediatric ward and it sparked my interest in working in hospitals. I started to gain a better understanding of children living their lives in hospitals, who require medical care from a very young age, and what that meant for their development and psychological health.",
      "After graduating I went into a Master’s programme from UCL and Yale, which blended psychology, neuroscience, and child development. After completing my MSc, I moved over to work as a researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital for several years, working within their Psychiatry Department and in the hospital’s Simulation Programme.",
      "Working in the hospital was incredibly meaningful and inspiring to me, and I really became invested in research around delivering medical education.  At the same time, I remained interested in pursuing my doctoral degree and sought out opportunities in the UK. I applied for and was offered a scholarship, funded by the LEGO Foundation and the Cambridge Trust, at Cambridge’s Play in Education, Development & Learning (PEDAL) Centre. For a long while my focus had been primarily on psychology and medicine, but by discovering more about the PEDAL Centre and their recent research funding, specifically in the area of play and health, I started to see avenues for my research in a new light. Critically, I identified a supervisor who was invested in research in the area of play and health and who was truly supportive of fostering new ideas in this academic space that bridges play research and medicine. It has been a winding journey to get to Cambridge, but I am sure that I have ended up in the right place.",
      "It was nerve-wracking to return to university life and academic studies after many years away. Aside from looking up information about Cambridge online while still living back home in America, I also asked to be linked up with a current PhD student in my research group. Speaking with her was invaluable - she was able to give me a first-person perspective on things that were unfamiliar to me, such as the Cambridge college system, supervisions, and PhD-level independence in academia. Living in college provided a built-in community where I was able to get to know people quickly, join activities, and identify familiar spaces, all while getting acclimated to the greater Cambridge city and my new academic life. It also meant that for that first year of living abroad and getting situated in a new city, I didn’t have to worry about setting up bills or finding a flat from the other side of the Atlantic.",
      "When working toward your PhD at Cambridge you are encouraged to foster your research skills and become an independent researcher. I benefit from immense amounts of support from my two research supervisors, as well as general academic support and resources from the Faculty of Education. This was particularly important during the pandemic and lockdown. It was undoubtedly a challenging time in many ways, but with the resources provided by my research group and the Faculty, I was able to pivot my research goals and timelines to adjust to the new reality, and feel like my physical and personal wellbeing were being cared for alongside my academic adjustments.",
      "Cambridge is very different to Boston (and the other Cambridge, Massachusetts), but I have really come to love this little city. Being able to explore the beautiful colleges and walk around such historic and picturesque architecture, is mindblowing – especially coming from America. It’s such a beautiful and intimate place to be. There’s a beauty to being in a small city; you can conceivably try every pub, restaurant, café, or park within the city parameters and truly get to know your favourite places and spaces – it is really special and makes it quickly feel like home. And, because it is so simple to take a fast train right to the heart of London, you are never too far from the hustle and bustle of big city life.",

      "Kelsey, from Boston in the United States, is a PhD candidate at Hughes Hall. Based in the Faculty of Education, her research focuses on the role of play in paediatric healthcare, with a specific interest in children’s own perspectives of play during hospitalisation.",
      "I had spent five years in the working world between by Master’s and my PhD, and throughout that time I developed a strong conceptualisation of what I wanted to focus on for doctoral level research. Cambridge not only had an open scholarship opportunity through the Cambridge Trust and LEGO Foundation, but I also identified a supervisor that really suited my area of interest - these were the two most critical components for me in choosing where to pursue further graduate study.",
      "I had been looking at PhD programmes for a while and was particularly interested in returning to a UK university as they tend to be more independent and project focused, as well as shorter term. My background is in psychology and child development and I was most concerned with finding a suitable research programme that would allow me to work with children.",
      "As an undergraduate I studied Psychology at Boston University, and through that degree I had the opportunity to spend time in London on a study abroad internship programme. I interned with a Play Specialist team on a paediatric ward and it sparked my interest in working in hospitals. I started to gain a better understanding of children living their lives in hospitals, who require medical care from a very young age, and what that meant for their development and psychological health.",
      "After graduating I went into a Master’s programme from UCL and Yale, which blended psychology, neuroscience, and child development. After completing my MSc, I moved over to work as a researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital for several years, working within their Psychiatry Department and in the hospital’s Simulation Programme.",
      "Working in the hospital was incredibly meaningful and inspiring to me, and I really became invested in research around delivering medical education.  At the same time, I remained interested in pursuing my doctoral degree and sought out opportunities in the UK. I applied for and was offered a scholarship, funded by the LEGO Foundation and the Cambridge Trust, at Cambridge’s Play in Education, Development & Learning (PEDAL) Centre. For a long while my focus had been primarily on psychology and medicine, but by discovering more about the PEDAL Centre and their recent research funding, specifically in the area of play and health, I started to see avenues for my research in a new light. Critically, I identified a supervisor who was invested in research in the area of play and health and who was truly supportive of fostering new ideas in this academic space that bridges play research and medicine. It has been a winding journey to get to Cambridge, but I am sure that I have ended up in the right place.",
      "It was nerve-wracking to return to university life and academic studies after many years away. Aside from looking up information about Cambridge online while still living back home in America, I also asked to be linked up with a current PhD student in my research group. Speaking with her was invaluable - she was able to give me a first-person perspective on things that were unfamiliar to me, such as the Cambridge college system, supervisions, and PhD-level independence in academia.

      "I knew I wanted to come to Cambridge as a postgraduate researcher while I was still studying for my undergraduate degree – it has one of the best Materials Science departments in the UK. I wanted to get my PhD from a world-renowned university, where the academics are leaders in their field and people are working with frontier knowledge.",
      "I studied for an MPhil in Materials Science and Metallurgy at Cambridge before starting my PhD here. I had always wanted to experience Cambridge, and while I was working for a summer school programme as an undergraduate I visited St John’s College and thought the city looked absolutely beautiful. Cambridge is full of intelligent and passionate people; the atmosphere of learning is great – and if you’re surrounded by intelligent people you learn from them. There is this unique and fascinating intersection between the innovative and the traditional sides of Cambridge. My college is soaked in history and tradition, but parts of the West Cambridge site, where my department is based, is almost futuristic and the equipment is state of the art.",
      "When I was at high school I was interested in physics, chemistry and maths, and I wanted to do something related to those three subjects. Materials Science was like a crossroads between them, it’s very interdisciplinary. During my undergraduate degree, in Materials Science and Engineering, I found that the biomaterial aspect of the subject was what interested me the most.",
      "My MPhil was a research degree, and the whole experience with the team and my supervisors made me sure a PhD at Cambridge was a good choice for me. I’m very interested in engineering, and making something real, something you can hold in your hands. I find that very fulfilling. As part of my PhD research I’m synthesising a new biodegradable polymer that should have antibacterial properties.",
      "When it came to applying to study at Cambridge I was able to find a lot of information online, and St John’s helped with finding college accommodation. Cambridge is a very peaceful place to live, but there are lots of interesting things going on. The colleges have regular events, like concerts and Evensong, and you get to meet lots of different people at Formals – students and academics. There are also many clubs and societies. And punting of course! It’s a welcoming place, people are friendly and helpful and there is a real sense of community. There are people to reach out to directly - you get support from your director of studies, and from your college tutor.",
      "There are a number of funding opportunities at Cambridge - I’m funded by St John’s College and the Cambridge Trust. There’s information on the University’s Postgraduate Admissions page about scholarships and I also spoke to my college’s postgraduate tutor, my supervisor and other PhD students. It’s quite a long process, and my advice would be to start looking into that as soon as possible.",
      "I’ve felt safe during the pandemic. Protocols have been put in place by my college, including hand sanitisers across the site and instructions about facemasks etc. My department has given us safety briefings, and has introduced a lot of layers of protection, in terms of organising how people work and carry out experiments. People know what they should be doing when they’re in the department.",
      "I see education as an investment, and a degree from such a prestigious university will definitely help when I’m looking for a job. I haven’t decided on a specific direction yet, but I may be looking to go into industry, possibly a biomaterials research role at a company. There are definitely options in Cambridge, because of the science parks and the tech firms based in the city, and the post-study work visa for international students in the UK. There is also a very dedicated careers service at Cambridge, and the opportunity to be part of a wide network of researchers made up of people from all over the world.",

      "Lu, from China, is a PhD candidate at St John’s College. Based in the Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, his research focuses on biodegradable polymers",
      "I knew I wanted to come to Cambridge as a postgraduate researcher while I was still studying for my undergraduate degree – it has one of the best Materials Science departments in the UK. I wanted to get my PhD from a world-renowned university, where the academics are leaders in their field and people are working with frontier knowledge.",
      "I studied for an MPhil in Materials Science and Metallurgy at Cambridge before starting my PhD here. I had always wanted to experience Cambridge, and while I was working for a summer school programme as an undergraduate I visited St John’s College and thought the city looked absolutely beautiful. Cambridge is full of intelligent and passionate people; the atmosphere of learning is great – and if you’re surrounded by intelligent people you learn from them. There is this unique and fascinating intersection between the innovative and the traditional sides of Cambridge. My college is soaked in history and tradition, but parts of the West Cambridge site, where my department is based, is almost futuristic and the equipment is state of the art.",
      "When I was at high school I was interested in physics, chemistry and maths, and I wanted to do something related to those three subjects. Materials Science was like a crossroads between them, it’s very interdisciplinary. During my undergraduate degree, in Materials Science and Engineering, I found that the biomaterial aspect of the subject was what interested me the most.",
      "My MPhil was a research degree, and the whole experience with the team and my supervisors made me sure a PhD at Cambridge was a good choice for me. I’m very interested in engineering, and making something real, something you can hold in your hands. I find that very fulfilling. As part of my PhD research I’m synthesising a new biodegradable polymer that should have antibacterial properties.",
      "When it came to applying to study at Cambridge I was able to find a lot of information online, and St John’s helped with finding college accommodation. Cambridge is a very peaceful place to live, but there are lots of interesting things going on. The colleges have regular events, like concerts and Evensong, and you get to meet lots of different people at Formals – students and academics. There are also many clubs and societies.

      "I applied to Cambridge after speaking to a supervisor here – to make sure I would be able to do the project I wanted to do - and because of the funding that was available. The University’s reputation is huge, and comes from the great researchers, past and present. But, for me, it was about making sure the support was going to be there to carry out my work.",
      "I had always planned to take postgraduate study – it seemed the most obvious way forward after I finished my degree in Biomedical Science at Imperial College London. And I’d already come up with the programme I wanted to work on. That was my focus and that’s what I wanted to continue with.",
      "My college was very helpful when I was applying to come here, particularly the tutorial office, and I was given all the information I needed at the right time. I filled out a form for my accommodation and they did everything else for me; they sent me pictures of all the places available for me to choose from. The admissions team were also helpful and replied to my questions quickly.",
      "When you apply to a course you automatically get considered for most of the scholarships available at Cambridge. I was accepted for the Harding Distinguished Postgraduate scholarship, it covers my tuition fees, and my college fees, which include accommodation and food, and a personal research allowance for conferences and such. There are also college-specific bursaries available - for those you have to apply directly to your college.",
      "My research is inspired by the insolvability of certain problems and the need to help all living things! I want to have a positive impact on daily life and on society. Throughout school, from the very beginning, I found the sciences and maths way more interesting than other subjects. When I reached high school, I just found diseases and the treatment of diseases so interesting that I decided that was the way I was going to go. At the time I couldn’t decide between medicine and biomedical science. I chose biomedical science because you can still do medicine afterwards. That’s how it started.",
      "The focus of my PhD is the development of an original cancer gene therapy, which I came up with during my undergraduate studies. The labs at Cambridge are a very collaborative environment, and everyone wants each other to succeed. I’ve also had great support from my supervisor, who takes the time to teach me and give advice. During the pandemic I’ve felt safe – the departments have been very organised and have introduced a lot of safety measures, such as the hand sanitisers and masks, and different ways of working.",
      "There are lots of opportunities to connect with industry, lots of networking events to help you get to know what others are doing, and a lot of support to help you move forward in your career. You read about this cool world and then it comes to life when you get here!",
      "The Christ’s community is very friendly, and if you have a problem there is someone to help you. You get to spend time with students and college Fellows regularly. There are special events to help postgraduates get to know people, and it’s great to see other perspectives outside of your department bubble. There are lots of things to love about Cambridge. I spend time in the gym and hang out with friends from the department. There’s plenty of space, and it’s also very convenient for connections and travel. London is very close, and Stansted Airport is also nearby if you want to fly somewhere.",
      "My advice to anyone thinking of applying is to go for it. You can see the history the alumni, these great people, have left behind, and it’s amazing to live and work in the same place, but you shouldn’t let that reputation scare you – you don’t need to compare yourself to other people. Those types of concerns disappear as soon as you get here.",

      "Nilesh, from India, is a PhD candidate at Christ’s College. Based in the Department of Pharmacology, his research focuses on a new cancer gene therapy",
      "I applied to Cambridge after speaking to a supervisor here – to make sure I would be able to do the project I wanted to do - and because of the funding that was available. The University’s reputation is huge, and comes from the great researchers, past and present. But, for me, it was about making sure the support was going to be there to carry out my work.",
      "I had always planned to take postgraduate study – it seemed the most obvious way forward after I finished my degree in Biomedical Science at Imperial College London. And I’d already come up with the programme I wanted to work on. That was my focus and that’s what I wanted to continue with.",
      "My college was very helpful when I was applying to come here, particularly the tutorial office, and I was given all the information I needed at the right time. I filled out a form for my accommodation and they did everything else for me; they sent me pictures of all the places available for me to choose from. The admissions team were also helpful and replied to my questions quickly.",
      "When you apply to a course you automatically get considered for most of the scholarships available at Cambridge. I was accepted for the Harding Distinguished Postgraduate scholarship, it covers my tuition fees, and my college fees, which include accommodation and food, and a personal research allowance for conferences and such. There are also college-specific bursaries available - for those you have to apply directly to your college.",
      "My research is inspired by the insolvability of certain problems and the need to help all living things! I want to have a positive impact on daily life and on society. Throughout school, from the very beginning, I found the sciences and maths way more interesting than other subjects. When I reached high school, I just found diseases and the treatment of diseases so interesting that I decided that was the way I was going to go. At the time I couldn’t decide between medicine and biomedical science. I chose biomedical science because you can still do medicine afterwards. That’s how it started.",
      "The focus of my PhD is the development of an original cancer gene therapy, which I came up with during my undergraduate studies. The labs at Cambridge are a very collaborative environment, and everyone wants each other to succeed. I’ve also had great support from my supervisor, who takes the time to teach me and give advice. During the pandemic I’ve felt safe – the departments have been very organised and have introduced a lot of safety measures, such as the hand sanitisers and masks, and different ways of working.",
      "There are lots of opportunities to connect with industry, lots of networking events to help you get to know what others are doing, and a lot of support to help you move forward in your career. You read about this cool world and then it comes to life when you get here!",
      "The Christ’s community is very friendly, and if you have a problem there is someone to help you. You get to spend time with students and college Fellows regularly. There are special events to help postgraduates get to know people, and it’s great to see other perspectives outside of your department bubble. There are lots of things to love about Cambridge. I spend time in the gym and hang out with friends from the department. There’s plenty of space, and it’s also very convenient for connections and travel. London is very close, and Stansted Airport is also nearby if you want to fly somewhere.",
      "My advice to anyone thinking of applying is to go for it. You can see the history the alumni, these great people, have left behind, and it’s amazing to live and work in the same place, but you shouldn’t let that reputation scare you – you don’t need to compare yourself to other people. Those types of concerns disappear as soon as you get here.",

      "In Their Own Words...",
      "Why did you choose to study at Cambridge?",
      "I chose Cambridge for a lot of reasons including the University’s excellent reputation. I chose it for its research facilities and because I was able to do bench-to-bedside research at Addenbrooke's Hospital.",
      "I also wanted to study at Cambridge so I could gain new experiences like College life in a beautiful city, and to be able to explore the other side of the world.",
      "I believed it was a place I could meet people and to build networks that would make my dreams come true. I am happy to say I wasn't wrong.",
      "I wanted to get the best education in order to achieve my goals. I found that it's an amazing environment here. It’s warm and welcoming and you feel you can always share thoughts and ideas with fellow scholars.",
      "What advice would you give applicants looking for funding?",
      "Talk to your potential supervisor about what funding is available for the program, look at different websites, and talk to students who are currently studying a similar subject at Cambridge.",
      "Search widely for funding opportunities from the University, Colleges, the government, and even NGOs. Do not neglect any funding as you may be able to combine different partial scholarships. You could also discuss funding opportunities with your potential supervisor.",
      "Check for College funding. Different Colleges have various levels of funding which can make a big difference to your experience. There are also certain bodies outside your Department and College that can be useful, like the Philosophical Society, which can give members up to three months funding if you run out!",

      "MCL students take a combination of full-year courses and one-term modules during the academic year.  All students take the compulsory full-year MCL-specific Deals course, which focuses on the legal and economic structuring of corporate transactions.  They also choose one full-year LLM paper from a selection of corporate papers on offer to MCL students (possible examples include Corporate Finance, Corporate Governance and International Financial Law).  In conjunction with the full-year papers, students take four one-term MCL-specific modules, usually two in the Michaelmas Term and two in the Lent Term.  The modules enable students to conduct a more detailed study of certain specialist areas of corporate law, such as shareholder litigation, international merger control and the law firm as business, than a general master's degree can offer.",
      "Prior to starting the course, MCL students are expected to be familiar with corporate law and to be motivated to develop their expertise in this challenging area.  Students who take the MCL should leave with a much-enriched understanding of the topic.  They will learn about areas of corporate law with which they were not previously familiar, will have an opportunity to reflect upon the theoretical and policy implications of the topic and will be challenged to think about the practical aspects of the subject in an academically rigorous manner.",

      "Applicants for this course should have achieved a UK First class Honours Degree.",
      "If your degree is not from the UK, please check International Qualifications to find the equivalent in your country.",
      "MCL enrolment is restricted to approximately 25 students, meaning competition for places is intense.  The normal minimum academic entry requirement for law graduates seeking admission to the Cambridge MCL is a top 5-10% ranking in their class.  In a UK university, this may equate to a First Class degree.  Extra weight may be given to the performance in courses related to corporate law.  Applicants will normally have a law degree, but those qualified to practise law who have a degree in another subject are welcome to apply.",
      "Students who are currently undertaking legal studies who will graduate soon can apply before completing their degree.  Successful applicants in this category are likely to have academic conditions attached to their offer.  If an offer is subject to academic conditions, to join the MCL in October 2025 the Postgraduate Admissions Office (PAO) must receive final evidence of the applicant having met the academic condition by 31 July 2025.  If potentially relevant academic results only become available after that date, it will not be possible for the applicant to be admitted to the MCL programme.",
      "English Language Requirements",
      "All applicants to the MCL programme who are not nationals of a country on the Postgraduate Admissions Office's ‘List A’ are required to take either the Academic IELTS English language proficiency test or the TOEFL English language proficiency test.  The only exception is if an applicant has successfully completed a three-year full-time bachelor's degree within the last two years in a country on List A, or is in the final year of study for a three-year full-time bachelor's degree in a country on List A.",
      "All MCL applicants who need to take an English language proficiency test must submit their test results with their course application or as soon as possible afterwards and by 1 April 2025 at the latest.",
      "Applicants must obtain all of the required Academic IELTS or TOEFL scores in the same test sitting; multiple test results cannot be combined to meet the language requirement.  Please note that we do not accept TOEFL MyBest™ scores.",
      "Language test scores must be less than two years old by the start of the MCL course in October 2025 in order to be valid.",
      "Please note that referrals to the University of Cambridge’s Language Centre for assessment are not available for the MCL course, and it is not possible to obtain a waiver of the language requirement.",

      "Lu, from China, is a PhD candidate at St John’s College. Based in the Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, his research focuses on biodegradable polymers",
      "I knew I wanted to come to Cambridge as a postgraduate researcher while I was still studying for my undergraduate degree – it has one of the best Materials Science departments in the UK. I wanted to get my PhD from a world-renowned university, where the academics are leaders in their field and people are working with frontier knowledge.",
      "I studied for an MPhil in Materials Science and Metallurgy at Cambridge before starting my PhD here. I had always wanted to experience Cambridge, and while I was working for a summer school programme as an undergraduate I visited St John’s College and thought the city looked absolutely beautiful. Cambridge is full of intelligent and passionate people; the atmosphere of learning is great – and if you’re surrounded by intelligent people you learn from them. There is this unique and fascinating intersection between the innovative and the traditional sides of Cambridge. My college is soaked in history and tradition, but parts of the West Cambridge site, where my department is based, is almost futuristic and the equipment is state of the art.",
      "When I was at high school I was interested in physics, chemistry and maths, and I wanted to do something related to those three subjects. Materials Science was like a crossroads between them, it’s very interdisciplinary. During my undergraduate degree, in Materials Science and Engineering, I found that the biomaterial aspect of the subject was what interested me the most.",
      "My MPhil was a research degree, and the whole experience with the team and my supervisors made me sure a PhD at Cambridge was a good choice for me. I’m very interested in engineering, and making something real, something you can hold in your hands. I find that very fulfilling. As part of my PhD research I’m synthesising a new biodegradable polymer that should have antibacterial properties.",
      "When it came to applying to study at Cambridge I was able to find a lot of information online, and St John’s helped with finding college accommodation. Cambridge is a very peaceful place to live, but there are lots of interesting things going on. The colleges have regular events, like concerts and Evensong, and you get to meet lots of different people at Formals – students and academics. There are also many clubs and societies. And punting of course! It’s a welcoming place, people are friendly and helpful and there is a real sense of community. There are people to reach out to directly - you get support from your director of studies, and from your college tutor.",
      "There are a number of funding opportunities at Cambridge - I’m funded by St John’s College and the Cambridge Trust. There’s information on the University’s Postgraduate Admissions page about scholarships and I also spoke to my college’s postgraduate tutor, my supervisor and other PhD students. It’s quite a long process, and my advice would be to start looking into that as soon as possible.",
      "I’ve felt safe during the pandemic. Protocols have been put in place by my college, including hand sanitisers across the site and instructions about facemasks etc. My department has given us safety briefings, and has introduced a lot of layers of protection, in terms of organising how people work and carry out experiments. People know what they should be doing when they’re in the department.",
      "I see education as an investment, and a degree from such a prestigious university will definitely help when I’m looking for a job. I haven’t decided on a specific direction yet, but I may be looking to go into industry, possibly a biomaterials research role at a company. There are definitely options in Cambridge, because of the science parks and the tech firms based in the city, and the post-study work visa for international students in the UK. There is also a very dedicated careers service at Cambridge, and the opportunity to be part of a wide network of researchers made up of people from all over the world.",

      "Akhila, from Hyderabad, India, is a PhD candidate at Murray Edwards College. Based in the Department of Chemistry, her research focuses on the electrical interactions within living systems at a cellular level",
      "The most exciting thing about Cambridge is the legacy of science and seeing how it carries on today. The network of talent is unique, and you’re surrounded by it. Cambridge is a hub of innovation, not only in fields like technology, health, and quantum physics, but it’s also a hub for some of the biggest pharma and software companies in the world, so it’s a great place to work on translational research.",
      "I was looking at British universities for my PhD, and, for me, Cambridge was the best place for multidisciplinary biomedical engineering. It was where I liked the labs the most. I joined the Chemistry department, but because of the academic freedom Cambridge offers, and with my supervisor’s support, I’ve been able to collaborate very well with other teams and departments. My collaboration with the Biochemistry department looks at the single-cell electron-generating behaviour of micro-organisms that have the ability to harvest sunlight and carbon dioxide, their potential to be harvested as a power source. I’ve also collaborated with Electrical Engineering, working on developing cell-friendly materials which are also electrically active, paving the way for a more biologically relevant bio-electronic study platform for cells. I’ve been able to do a lot of things I might have otherwise not been able to.",
      "My initial exposure to science came from my father, who studied molecular genetics. My mum has always been the artist and my creativity comes from her side. At school I enjoyed science projects and I began to think that doing research might suit me.",
      "Cambridge is the third phase of my academic journey. I studied Biomedical Engineering for my undergraduate degree, at Osmania University and the University of California Riverside (UCR). It opened the door in terms of research, and thinking about how I could work on applied engineering. I did my Master’s in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, and while I was there I was able to volunteer with a public health NGO.",
      "For my PhD, I had always wanted to be involved in topics related to health and human life. I wanted to learn how to conduct research and be trained in asking the right questions and continue learning. Cambridge is a huge learning curve, but it means you become a much more independent researcher. There is a lot of problem solving, and there is a lot of support available through the interdisciplinary teams.",
      "When I was applying to Cambridge I found a lot of information online – on the department pages, on the labs’ pages, and on the pages of individual lab members. I actually applied to three different departments, because all of them were involved in the work I wanted to do. And I had a number of phone and video calls with professors in those departments who were extremely friendly and very helpful.",
      "My funding came from Gates Cambridge Trust which oversees the Gates Cambridge scholarship programme for international postgraduate students. It is very flexible in terms of the scope of your study. I applied for it when I applied to the department, and the programme itself is actually one of my biggest sources of support and community here. I feel very thankful for that - the international aspect, the fact that there are students from diverse backgrounds and many countries. The fact there is such a big international community somehow makes me feel closer to home.",
      "Cambridge is a completely different experience to anything I’ve had before, especially the college aspect of life. Because you’re part of a college community, you get to meet people from different departments and have really nice experiences, like picnics on the grass, conversations with people you might not have otherwise met. There is a lot of support.  Life during the pandemic is a challenge, but I think the University has been doing everything it can to keep us safe.",
      "I’m really glad I came to Murray Edwards because I’m a huge supporter of women in education, particularly STEM. I’ve been involved with the college’s student committee, and have been its president. I’ve had an opportunity to do lots of other things in Cambridge, around science and policy, around student organisations, around the commercialisation of research work. It’s been really incredible.",
      "My advice to anyone else applying is to reach out to people and see where you fit. The biggest benefit is really the way Cambridge is set up, because you’re not just restricted to your own department. You get the opportunity to meet people from across the university. Having a PhD from Cambridge is going to open that initial door to let you go and pursue whatever you want. That could be securing a position within a company – firms specifically come to Cambridge to hire Cambridge graduates – or it could be postdoc opportunities, funding opportunities, research collaborations, or exposure. It’s a legacy you can bank on.",

      "Kelsey, from Boston in the United States, is a PhD candidate at Hughes Hall. Based in the Faculty of Education, her research focuses on the role of play in paediatric healthcare, with a specific interest in children’s own perspectives of play during hospitalisation.",
      "I had spent five years in the working world between by Master’s and my PhD, and throughout that time I developed a strong conceptualisation of what I wanted to focus on for doctoral level research. Cambridge not only had an open scholarship opportunity through the Cambridge Trust and LEGO Foundation, but I also identified a supervisor that really suited my area of interest - these were the two most critical components for me in choosing where to pursue further graduate study.",
      "I had been looking at PhD programmes for a while and was particularly interested in returning to a UK university as they tend to be more independent and project focused, as well as shorter term. My background is in psychology and child development and I was most concerned with finding a suitable research programme that would allow me to work with children.",
      "As an undergraduate I studied Psychology at Boston University, and through that degree I had the opportunity to spend time in London on a study abroad internship programme. I interned with a Play Specialist team on a paediatric ward and it sparked my interest in working in hospitals. I started to gain a better understanding of children living their lives in hospitals, who require medical care from a very young age, and what that meant for their development and psychological health.",
      "After graduating I went into a Master’s programme from UCL and Yale, which blended psychology, neuroscience, and child development. After completing my MSc, I moved over to work as a researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital for several years, working within their Psychiatry Department and in the hospital’s Simulation Programme.",
      "Working in the hospital was incredibly meaningful and inspiring to me, and I really became invested in research around delivering medical education.  At the same time, I remained interested in pursuing my doctoral degree and sought out opportunities in the UK. I applied for and was offered a scholarship, funded by the LEGO Foundation and the Cambridge Trust, at Cambridge’s Play in Education, Development & Learning (PEDAL) Centre. For a long while my focus had been primarily on psychology and medicine, but by discovering more about the PEDAL Centre and their recent research funding, specifically in the area of play and health, I started to see avenues for my research in a new light. Critically, I identified a supervisor who was invested in research in the area of play and health and who was truly supportive of fostering new ideas in this academic space that bridges play research and medicine. It has been a winding journey to get to Cambridge, but I am sure that I have ended up in the right place.",
      "It was nerve-wracking to return to university life and academic studies after many years away. Aside from looking up information about Cambridge online while still living back home in America, I also asked to be linked up with a current PhD student in my research group. Speaking with her was invaluable - she was able to give me a first-person perspective on things that were unfamiliar to me, such as the Cambridge college system, supervisions, and PhD-level independence in academia. Living in college provided a built-in community where I was able to get to know people quickly, join activities, and identify familiar spaces, all while getting acclimated to the greater Cambridge city and my new academic life. It also meant that for that first year of living abroad and getting situated in a new city, I didn’t have to worry about setting up bills or finding a flat from the other side of the Atlantic.",
      "When working toward your PhD at Cambridge you are encouraged to foster your research skills and become an independent researcher. I benefit from immense amounts of support from my two research supervisors, as well as general academic support and resources from the Faculty of Education. This was particularly important during the pandemic and lockdown. It was undoubtedly a challenging time in many ways, but with the resources provided by my research group and the Faculty, I was able to pivot my research goals and timelines to adjust to the new reality, and feel like my physical and personal wellbeing were being cared for alongside my academic adjustments.",
      "Cambridge is very different to Boston (and the other Cambridge, Massachusetts), but I have really come to love this little city. Being able to explore the beautiful colleges and walk around such historic and picturesque architecture, is mindblowing – especially coming from America. It’s such a beautiful and intimate place to be. There’s a beauty to being in a small city; you can conceivably try every pub, restaurant, café, or park within the city parameters and truly get to know your favourite places and spaces – it is really special and makes it quickly feel like home. And, because it is so simple to take a fast train right to the heart of London, you are never too far from the hustle and bustle of big city life.",

      "Nilesh, from India, is a PhD candidate at Christ’s College. Based in the Department of Pharmacology, his research focuses on a new cancer gene therapy",
      "I applied to Cambridge after speaking to a supervisor here – to make sure I would be able to do the project I wanted to do - and because of the funding that was available. The University’s reputation is huge, and comes from the great researchers, past and present. But, for me, it was about making sure the support was going to be there to carry out my work.",
      "I had always planned to take postgraduate study – it seemed the most obvious way forward after I finished my degree in Biomedical Science at Imperial College London. And I’d already come up with the programme I wanted to work on. That was my focus and that’s what I wanted to continue with.",
      "My college was very helpful when I was applying to come here, particularly the tutorial office, and I was given all the information I needed at the right time. I filled out a form for my accommodation and they did everything else for me; they sent me pictures of all the places available for me to choose from. The admissions team were also helpful and replied to my questions quickly.",
      "When you apply to a course you automatically get considered for most of the scholarships available at Cambridge. I was accepted for the Harding Distinguished Postgraduate scholarship, it covers my tuition fees, and my college fees, which include accommodation and food, and a personal research allowance for conferences and such. There are also college-specific bursaries available - for those you have to apply directly to your college.",
      "My research is inspired by the insolvability of certain problems and the need to help all living things! I want to have a positive impact on daily life and on society. Throughout school, from the very beginning, I found the sciences and maths way more interesting than other subjects. When I reached high school, I just found diseases and the treatment of diseases so interesting that I decided that was the way I was going to go. At the time I couldn’t decide between medicine and biomedical science. I chose biomedical science because you can still do medicine afterwards. That’s how it started.",
      "The focus of my PhD is the development of an original cancer gene therapy, which I came up with during my undergraduate studies. The labs at Cambridge are a very collaborative environment, and everyone wants each other to succeed. I’ve also had great support from my supervisor, who takes the time to teach me and give advice. During the pandemic I’ve felt safe – the departments have been very organised and have introduced a lot of safety measures, such as the hand sanitisers and masks, and different ways of working.",
      "There are lots of opportunities to connect with industry, lots of networking events to help you get to know what others are doing, and a lot of support to help you move forward in your career. You read about this cool world and then it comes to life when you get here!",
      "The Christ’s community is very friendly, and if you have a problem there is someone to help you. You get to spend time with students and college Fellows regularly. There are special events to help postgraduates get to know people, and it’s great to see other perspectives outside of your department bubble. There are lots of things to love about Cambridge. I spend time in the gym and hang out with friends from the department. There’s plenty of space, and it’s also very convenient for connections and travel. London is very close, and Stansted Airport is also nearby if you want to fly somewhere.",
      "My advice to anyone thinking of applying is to go for it. You can see the history the alumni, these great people, have left behind, and it’s amazing to live and work in the same place, but you shouldn’t let that reputation scare you – you don’t need to compare yourself to other people. Those types of concerns disappear as soon as you get here.",

      "Alex, from California, chose to study for an MPhil degree in Physics at Churchill College. Based in the NanoPhotonics Centre, his research focuses on light and nanotechnology",
      "Cambridge is such a unique place to study and to do research. It’s got a great community and you’re always interacting and making connections with different people - from different fields and from lots of different countries. I feel like I get to learn something or to solve something every day.",
      "As a researcher, a lot of your happiness and satisfaction comes from your work, and at Cambridge my research group has really reinvigorated my enthusiasm for science. People are happy in general and that makes such a difference - they’re enthusiastic and energetic about the science.",
      "Cambridge University is one of the best academic institutions in the world, and the quality of learning is excellent. Since school my academic interests have been around science and physics. And Cambridge, in particular the Cavendish Laboratory, is a huge part of the story of physics. Initially, I was daunted by the University’s academic reputation, but the people here are so kind and helpful. Before you come to Cambridge you only really know it for its big reputation, but you get here and you find it’s a warm and welcoming place with a really collaborative atmosphere. I went from imposter syndrome to feeling like this place was my second home!",
      "The focus of my work is nanoscience and the study of light. Throughout history, light has been a key tool in helping us understand the world. I’m using it to see what’s going on at a cellular level. I’m fascinated by light, and the potential to use it in all sorts of new ways - in place of circuits or electrical systems, for example.",
      "My undergraduate degree was in Physics and Electrical Engineering. I studied at Rice University in Texas, and that’s where I started my research. After that I really wanted to experience doing research full time, and not having to worry about classes. That’s why the MPhil at Cambridge is really unique – it’s one of the only degrees at Master’s level which lets you do that. I wanted to come to Cambridge for a year to grow as a scientist and develop a more mature vision before going on to a PhD. It’s been about learning to make decisions independently, which can be a hard thing to learn, but it’s been a huge benefit.",
      "When I was first looking into studying at Cambridge I found a lot of information online - on the University website, reading blogs, watching videos on YouTube. There’s actually more funding available than people realise. My funding came from the Churchill Scholarship, which sends US students to study at Churchill College every year.",
      "Being a Master’s student at Cambridge means that as well as being a researcher at a university you’re also a part of the whole community because of the college system. Everyone’s living in the same area, so you’re not completely separate from undergraduates and other postgraduates.",
      "The traditions here will be some of my fondest memories  – cycling every day gives me so much joy, and being part of the Formals [traditional dinners] with so many other people is really special. It’s amazing to experience that side of Cambridge. And the extracurricular side of things is really vibrant too. Music is such a big part of my life - I play the viola, and there aren’t a lot of violists in general, so musical groups always need a viola! I’ve played in a lot of different groups across Cambridge, from accompanying choirs to playing in musical theatres.",
      "This is my first time in England, and I’ve had the most wonderful year at Cambridge - even with the pandemic. The College has been supportive and I’ve also been impressed with how my department handled the lockdown. It was operational again as soon as possible, and that’s a testament to the organisation here. I’ve felt very safe with the all the precautions, and happy that I could get back to my research so soon.",
      "Coming here has given me so many more connections to researchers and collaborations in Europe, and in general, and having Cambridge on my CV will be absolutely fantastic and help me stand out back in the US. But it’s also about being around these incredible people who push you to keep growing and progressing.",

      "I clicked with the professors here – that’s why I chose Cambridge for my PhD. I had considered a lot of universities in the application phase; I already had a research programme in mind, so I looked at different research groups in similar fields and talked to them. I wanted to find out which one I would enjoy the most, and it was Cambridge.",
      "It only takes 3-4 years, ideally, to finish a PhD programme in the UK, which is shorter than most countries. I also wanted to live in the UK and experience the culture. I already had some friends studying here, and when I asked them about their experience they said the main concern was the weather! Cambridge is a big name in the world, it’s one of the top ranked universities and has an incredible reputation. Stephen Hawking is my favourite scientist of all time, and you only need to look at all the Nobel Prize winners who were at Cambridge to know it’s a special place.",
      "When I was applying to study at Cambridge, the first thing I looked at was the university website, and the links to pages specifically for postgraduate programmes. There’s a lot of information about what the requirements are, and the documents you need to submit, and most importantly the deadlines for submitting them. I also emailed the department and the admissions team with some questions and they came back to me quickly.",
      "As an undergraduate I studied Engineering, specialising in Materials Science, at Central South University and Monash University. My PhD at Cambridge focuses on myocardial regeneration. There is a lot of support in my team and in the department. People are really friendly, and there’s no such thing as a silly question. You don’t have to be perfect; the most important thing is to take the initiative and not be afraid to reach out. You just need to be ready to contribute and discuss, and have ideas.",
      "I’m funded by the Cambridge Trust, which pays for my University fees, and the China Scholarship Council, which pays for my living costs. My advice would be to secure your funding as soon as possible, because there are deadlines and it’s quite competitive.",
      "Cambridge is a lovely city. Most of my social life revolves around my college and I’ve been taken really good care of.  If you keep your eyes open there are lots of opportunities – there are Formals [traditional dinners] every week, and it’s a good break from the lab and a chance to chat to people from different departments, including students and Fellows. There are bar nights and cycle trips to Grantchester. I’ve also joined the Cambridge Union and have enjoyed the debates. That’s the thing I love about Cambridge – all these little traditions that I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to experience. It’s a lot of fun.",
      "I stayed in college accommodation during the pandemic lockdown, and there was a lot support and help, such as a ‘buddy system’ for those who needed to self-isolate. Plenty of safety measures have been put in place so I feel safe here. The department I work in has also introduced layers of precautions.",
      "Cambridge opens up so many possibilities. The university careers service is also a huge benefit, and the network of alumni is extraordinary. There are opportunities to attend workshops to explore your future career options, to modify your CV for specific job applications, and to even do mock interviews if you wish.",

A Cambridge PhD is intellectually demanding and you will need to have a high level of attainment and motivation to pursue this programme of advanced study and research. In most faculties a candidate is expected to have completed one year of postgraduate study, normally on a research preparation masters course, prior to starting a PhD.",
      "Completion normally requires three or four years of full-time study, or at least five years of part-time study, including a probationary period.

You are registered for the PhD only after a satisfactory progress assessment at the end of the probationary year (five terms for part-time degrees). The assessment is designed also to focus your mind on the stages necessary for completion of your research within the normal time limit and to address any structural problems that have arisen during the first year. The progress examination/assessment at the end of year one is a substantial academic hurdle and continuation to the PhD is not automatic.",
      "During your PhD, your effort will be focused on writing a dissertation of up to 80,000 words. This must represent a significant contribution to learning, for example through the discovery of new knowledge, the connection of previously unrelated facts, the development of a new theory, or the revision of older views, and must take account of previously published work on the subject. Many Cambridge dissertations go on to form the basis of significant publications.",
      "Although you will spend long hours working independently, your department and college will support you in different ways. You are also able to attend regular seminars in your subject area, might be involved in teaching, perhaps giving seminars or supervising, and can play an integral part in the social life of your department and College.",
